This repo is full of exercises to accompany [@RebootJeff](https://www.twitter.com/rebootjeff)'s class on JavaScript recursion.

## Instructions

Use the **Download Zip** button on the right-hand side of this repo's [main webpage](https://github.com/RebootJeff/js-recursion). Extract the files from your downloaded copy of the zip. Open exercises as instructed during the class. Follow the instructions provided by the `README.md` files.

You can also just view the exercises on GitHub.com (which does a nice job of displaying the `README.md` files).

If you struggle to complete an exercise:

1. Try to identify what you don't understand.
2. Try to debug your code with `console.log()` or Chrome Dev Tools.
3. Search the Internet (because this is what pros do all the time) for help.
4. Ask TAs for help.

Use the following tools as you see fit:

- **Sublime Text** for writing code
- **jsbin.com** or **repl.it** for writing and running code
- **Google Search** (yes, I'm serious)

### A Note About Teaching Assistants (TAs)

Feel free to ask TAs for help. They are here to help you! A good rule of thumb is to try searching the Internet for help first. Then convert your struggle into a clear set of questions. Then ask those questions to a TA.

**Beware:** The TAs are not going to give away *solutions*. They are going to give *help*. This means they will help you identify what you don't understand, help you debug your code, help you search the Internet, help you teach *yourself*, etc. Please be patient with them as they are patient with you.

### A Note About Exercises

If you are unfamiliar with JavaScript syntax, don't worry. Try searching Google for what you need. For example, if you find yourself wishing you could find out all the keys of an object, then perhaps you should Google "get keys of javascript object" and teach yourself how to use `Object.keys()`. The exercises will help you learn other aspects of JavaScript such as Array methods, Object methods, etc.
